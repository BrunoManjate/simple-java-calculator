This is a simple calculator written in Java, designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, division, multiplication, and subtraction. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface where users can input numbers and choose the desired operation to perform.

## Key Features:
### Addition:

<p>Allows users to add two numbers together.
<p>Example: 5 + 3 = 8.

### Subtraction:

<p>Allows users to subtract one number from another.
<p>Example: 9 - 4 = 5.

### Multiplication:

Allows users to multiply two numbers.
Example: 7 * 2 = 14.

### Division:

<p>Allows users to divide one number by another.
<p>Example: 8 / 2 = 4.

# Includes error handling for division by zero.
## Implementation Details:

### User Interface:

<p>The calculator has a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing.
<p>The interface includes buttons for digits (0-9) and basic operations (+, -, *, /).
<p>There is a display area where the input numbers and results are shown.

### Functionality:

<p>Each button click is handled by an event listener that processes the input and updates the display.
<p>The calculator maintains the current state of the operation, allowing for continuous calculations.
<p>Error messages are displayed for invalid operations, such as division by zero.

### Code Structure:

<p>The project is structured with a main class that sets up the GUI and initializes the calculator.
<p>Action listeners are implemented to handle button clicks and perform the respective operations.
<p>The code is modular, making it easy to read and maintain.
<p>Example Usage:

### add two numbers:

Enter the first number, press the addition button (+), enter the second number, and press the equals button (=).

### To subtract one number from another:

Enter the first number, press the subtraction button (-), enter the second number, and press the equals button (=).

### To multiply two numbers:

Enter the first number, press the multiplication button (*), enter the second number, and press the equals button (=).

### To divide one number by another:

Enter the first number, press the division button (/), enter the second number, and press the equals button (=).
This simple calculator is a great tool for learning basic Java programming concepts, including GUI design and event handling. It can be easily modified to include additional features or customized to fit specific business rules.
